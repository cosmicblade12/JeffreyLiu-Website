        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Jeffrey Liu who currently attends the University of California, Riverside. I am a freshman who almost has enough credits to be considered a sophomore. My current major is Pre-Business and I plan to apply to the School of Business by the middle of next year. I am Chinese with fluent mandarin speaking. I have two years of experience of teaching as I tutored an elementary student in math.
<br><br>

        During my high school career, I was part of the Basketball and Running programs at Prospect High School. For both programs, I have many experiences of being a leader. For the basketball team, I was the captain. As the captain, I was given many responsibilities such as always being there for practice and also acting as the coach when the real coach was either late or unable to come. There I was able to help give advice to my teammates and also teach the younger players the culture of being part of the basketball team at Prospect. Also I took part in helping teach younger kids how to play basketball. During this time I was able to help guide the younger generations and show my ability of being a leader. During track and field, I took part in the middle school meets. The role I had at the middle school meets was to help make sure the events were moving smoothly. This meant I had to multitask between starting and recording the event. I also had to communicate with all the coaches including both the high school and middle school coaches.<br><br>

        Also during my high school career, I was a tutor for 2 years almost 3 years. I was scouted out to be a tutor because one of my friendsâ€™ mom recognized my talent for math and teaching. Also they knew that I was very patient and calm. The student I was assigned was considered autistic and also had terrible anger management. Despite all of that, I was motivated to teach him and improve his grades. During the tutor sessions, I learned that I had to be pushy while remaining nice as well. I made him cry twice, but still I believe that it had to happen to help improve his grades. Tutoring has shown my multitasking skills because I had to grade and create problems on the spot. Also, I had to do some research because I wanted to be the best tutor I could be for my student, which shows my dedication to important things. During my two years of teaching, I was able to improve his grade from a C to a B and A. Showing that I have some quality of being a teacher. Currently at University of California, Riverside I am very active in my club, Chinese Student Association, and have shown loyalty throughout my first and second quarter. As of now I am applying to be an intern at a Public Relation at my club, because I believe that it will help me in the future. I am hoping that I will continue to grow as a student in the future.
